## Workflow üñ®Ô∏è
Below there's some gifs in regards of my workflow (kinda). My philosophy in such regard is this:

Don't rice for unique complicated workflow, rice for simple human workflow

(Also, compression made it look kinda bad, but I think it shows what it needs to)

### Mousepdad and Keyboard
I pretty much used the configuration explained here https://cravencode.com/post/essentials/enable-tap-to-click-in-i3wm/ and applied it to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
Creddit for configuration goes for Cody Craven :)2

AND DON'T FORGET TO READ WHAT'S WRITTEN AT THE END OF THE MAIN INSTALLATION SECTION [UP THERE](#inst). Further steps are specified there. (Yes. Absolutely needs to be shouty capitals.)
<a id="deps"></a>

Ahhhhh the other main stuff. Here you go, peeps. Make sure you have em all.

-    xmonad (OF COURSE, DUH)

-    firefox (Yup)
-    rofi version 1.6.0 (Configs originally come from @adi1090x, been edited by me).
-    tint2 (Install using package manager, other binary from my fork is provided)
-    acpi
-    Museo Sans Font by Adobe (I think it needs some sort of acount, but get it) Or just search for it on the web and get it somewhere

-    zsh (THIS IS IMPORTANT)
-    alacritty

-    jq: Command line json parser (Needed for widgets)
-    maim and xclip for screenshots
-    mpv for low-battery sound playing (Not exactly necessary, you'll get the notification, but the sound depends on it.)
-    *Might need to be updated, so please tell me*

<a id="trouble"></a>
## Troubleshooting üî´
And here we are:


1. If xmonad doesn't build make sure you have `xmonad-contrib`
2. Bar looks weird: Try editing it a bit using `tint2conf`. 
3. Alacritty configs are faulty: I'm not sure about this one, works perfectly fine for me. 
4. Widgets positioning weird: I hardcoded them for a 1366x768 screen, will create others if I can
5. Fonts: GET THOSE FONTS!
6. **MAKE SURE YOUR `~/bin` DIRECTORY IS IN YOUR PATH, OR NOTHING WILL WORK!** (Yes. Absolutely needs to be shouty capitals.)
7. Anything else? Open up an issue.
8. Workspace indicator bar lost colors: This has a very long explanation, but the fix is as follows:
   - Open up the `~/.config/tint2/workspaces.tint2rc` file, and scroll down to the taskbar module at around line 120
   - Add this line in that block: `taskbar_name_unoccupied_font_color = #ffd5cd 100`
   - Save the file, and refresh the bar with hitting the keybind `Win + B` twice.
   - Remember not to edit that particular file with `tint2conf`, or you'll have to do this again!
